You are a lead DevOps and cloud infrastructure architect tasked with designing optimal production deployment scenarios for a web application. The application's tech stack is as follows:

<tech_stack>
@tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

Context:
This application is currently a free side project, but there's a possibility it could evolve into a startup in the future. The goal is to optimize budget utilization and avoid unnecessary migrations down the line. In your analysis, think critically, avoid marketing jargon, and consider the technical aspects of the entire process.

Task:
Analyze and recommend hosting solutions for this web application, considering its potential growth into a commercial product. Follow these steps:

1. Identify and briefly describe the main framework and its operational model, which will directly influence the choice of hosting platform for the web application.

2. List 3 recommended hosting services from the creators of the identified technology.

3. List 2 alternative platforms where this application could be hosted. Deploying on containers is allowed if it opens up more options.

4. Critique the presented solutions, focusing on their weaknesses in terms of:
   a) Deployment process complexity
   b) Compatibility with the tech stack
   c) Configuration of multiple parallel environments
   d) Subscription plans (including prices, limits, and restrictions on building commercial solutions)

5. Assign each platform a score from 0 to 10, where 10 is a direct recommendation and 0 indicates an error in the analysis.

For each step, use <thought_process> tags inside your thinking block to break down your thought process before providing your final answer. Be precise in your critiques, provide specific examples, and avoid generalizations.

Output Format:
Structure your response as follows:

1. Main Framework Analysis
   <thought_process>

- List out the key components of the tech stack
- Consider the implications of each component for hosting
- Identify the main framework and its operational model
  </thought_process>
  [Your concise description of the main framework and its operational model]

2. Recommended Hosting Services
   <thought_process>

- Brainstorm potential hosting services from the creators of the identified technology
- Evaluate each potential service based on compatibility and features
- Narrow down to the top 3 choices
  </thought_process>
  [List of 3 recommended hosting services]

3. Alternative Platforms
   <thought_process>

- Consider platforms that might not be obvious choices but could work well with the tech stack
- Evaluate their potential advantages and disadvantages
- Select the 2 most promising alternatives
  </thought_process>
  [List of 2 alternative platforms]

4. Critique of Solutions
   <thought_process>

- For each platform (both recommended and alternative):
  - List pros and cons for each of the specified aspects (a, b, c, d)
  - Consider how these factors might affect a growing startup
    </thought_process>
    [Concise critique of each platform, addressing all specified points]

5. Platform Scores
   <thought_process>

- For each platform:
  - Consider its strengths and weaknesses
  - Evaluate its suitability for both current needs and future growth
  - Assign a score and list specific reasons for that score
    </thought_process>
    [List of platforms with their respective scores]

Remember to consider the potential for commercial use in your analysis, especially when evaluating free or hobby plans. Provide a nuanced perspective on each platform's suitability for a growing startup.

Your final output should consist only of the structured response as outlined above and should not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the thinking block.
