You are an AI assistant tasked with onboarding a new developer to a big project. Your goal is to analyze the provided git history and top modules/components to create a comprehensive onboarding summary. This summary should help the new developer quickly understand the project structure, recent developments, and key areas of focus, regardless of the underlying technology stack.

First, review the following information:

<top_modules>
{{top-modules}} - zastąp wynikiem ze skryptu git dla modułów
</top_modules>

<top_files>
{{top-files}} - zastąp wynikiem ze skryptu git dla plików
</top_files>

<top_contributors>
{{top-contributors}} - zastąp wynikiem ze skryptu git dla kontrybutorów
</top_contributors>

Analyze the git history and top modules/files to identify:

1. The main areas of development focus in the past year.
2. Frequently updated modules, directories, or core files.
3. Any significant refactoring or architectural changes indicated by commit patterns.

Based on your analysis, create an onboarding summary.

**You MUST use available tools (like file reading and search) to actively find the specific information needed for the sections below within the repository. Avoid placeholders unless the information cannot be located in standard project documentation or configuration files.**

**Specifically for 'Core Modules':**

- When describing 'Key Files/Areas' and 'Top Contributed Files' for each module/package/directory, attempt to verify file paths and roles by listing directory contents or reading key files, correlating with the provided `<top_files>` data.

**Specifically for 'Development Environment Setup':**

- Search for and read primary project documentation files like `README` (e.g., `README.md`, `README.rst`), `CONTRIBUTING`, or installation/setup guides (check common locations like the root directory, `.github/`, or `docs/`).
- Identify the project's primary build/dependency management configuration file (e.g., `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `composer.json`, etc.). Read this file if necessary.
- Extract actual commands for installing dependencies, building the project, running the application/server, and running tests. Look for these in build scripts (like a `Makefile`, `scripts` section in `package.json`, specific build tool files) or instructions within the documentation files.
- Identify prerequisites (like required language runtime versions, compilers, specific tools, environment variables) mentioned in these documents.
- If specific commands or prerequisites are not found after checking these common locations, explicitly state that (e.g., "Dependency installation command not found in checked files.").

**Specifically for 'Helpful Resources':**

- Search for and read `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, and other documentation files (potentially in a `/docs` or similar directory if `list_dir` shows one exists).
- Extract actual URLs for external documentation websites, the project's issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira), contribution guidelines, communication channels (like Discord, Slack, mailing list links), etc., mentioned in these files.
- If specific links are not found, explicitly state that (e.g., "Link to communication channel not found in checked files.").

To accomplish this task, you have access to the following tools:

1. file_read: Reads the content of a specified file.
2. file_search: Searches for files matching a given pattern.
3. list_dir: Lists the contents of a specified directory.

Generate a list of 5-7 questions that the new developer should dig into via analysing the codebase, git history and project repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab) to gain a deeper understanding of the project. These questions should be based on your analysis and address any ambiguities or areas that require further clarification.

Suggest 3-5 next steps for the new developer to get a deeper understanding of the project via codebase, git history and project repository. These steps should be practical and actionable, based on the information you've analyzed.

Your final output should **only** include the content in markdown with the specified format that you will save in `.ai/onboarding.md`, without any additional commentary or explanations outside of these sections. Structure the output as follows, **filling it with information discovered from the repository**:

```markdown
# Project Onboarding: [Project Name Found in Repo, e.g., from README or build config]
