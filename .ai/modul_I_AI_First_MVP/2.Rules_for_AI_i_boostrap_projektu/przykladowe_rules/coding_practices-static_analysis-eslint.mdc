## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Configure project-specific rules in eslint.config.js to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Implement custom rules for {{project_specific_patterns}} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code
