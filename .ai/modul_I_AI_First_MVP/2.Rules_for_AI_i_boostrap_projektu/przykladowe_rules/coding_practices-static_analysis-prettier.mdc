## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### PRETTIER

- Define a consistent .prettierrc configuration across all {{project_repositories}}
- Configure editor integration to format on save for immediate feedback
- Use .prettierignore to exclude generated files, build artifacts, and {{specific_excluded_patterns}}
- Set printWidth based on team preferences (80-120 characters) to improve code readability
- Configure consistent quote style and semicolon usage to match team conventions
- Implement CI checks to ensure all committed code adheres to the defined style
