## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### JEST

- Use Jest with TypeScript for type checking in tests
- Implement Testing Library for component testing instead of enzyme
- Use snapshot testing sparingly and only for stable UI components
- Leverage mock functions and spies for isolating units of code
- Implement test setup and teardown with beforeEach and afterEach
- Use describe blocks for organizing related tests
- Leverage expect assertions with specific matchers
- Implement code coverage reporting with meaningful targets
- Use mockResolvedValue and mockRejectedValue for async testing
- Leverage fake timers for testing time-dependent functionality
